## bat files for easy batch converting images with geometrize minimal library

### what is it and why should i care?
it's simple and dirty bat files i made for someone who needed to batch convert some of their images using [geometrize-library](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/geometrize-lib-example)

### how to use?
put your images in the "in" folder and use geometrize.bat or geometrized_advanced.bat for more options, after the process is complete the converted images can be found in the "out" folder

### the binary is out of date
yes, but i'm not using windows anymore and don't know if the new binary files are working since it's an automated process that makes them, you can download newer versions by going to [this page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/geometrize-lib-example-bucket/index.html) just make sure the rename the binary or edit the bat files to the new name

### something went wrong, how could i fix?
i'll try to help if i can but my knowlege of the language is pretty limited so you are better served searching online
